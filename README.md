Smart Meter Data Analysis System - SMAS
======================

Figure 1 shows the architecture of SMAS.  The real-time layer consumes raw smart meter data and runs simple alerting queries, such as those which detect very high consumption readings.  The batch layer packages raw data into chunks that are batch-loaded into the analytics database, e.g., once an hour or once a day.  The batch layer also accepts bulk-uploads, e.g., historical consumption data from legacy systems.  The analytics layer, which is the focus of this paper, consists of an underlying database, analytics libraries, and a Web front-end.  In addition to the consumption time series generated by smart meters, the database also contains the location of each consumer and hourly temperature data obtained from a local weather station.  Thus far, we have implemented the analytics layer; we envision implementing the real-time layer using a data stream engine and the batch layer using a database system or Hadoop/Hive.

Figure 2 shows the analytics layer, which uses PostgreSQL as the database and MADLib as the (in-database) machine learning library.  Furthermore, we use Highcharts (www.highcharts.com) as the visualization engine, and Tomcat as the web application server.  The main functionalities of SMAS include consumer feedback, segmentation (clustering) analysis and forecasting.  Each of these tasks requires a set of features and patterns to be extracted from the data (which are then stored in materialized views).
